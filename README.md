# Rio-Rx-Sales-and-Inventory-Management-System

Is a web-based platform that unifies point-of-sale, stock control, supplier and customer records, and user roles into a single dashboard. Cashiers ring up sales which auto-deduct from inventory, while receiving entries and low-stock alerts keep your shelves optimally stocked. Administrators can assign permissions, review daily sales and transaction counts, and view per-user performanceâ€”all in real time. Comprehensive reporting tools let you analyze trends, manage expiries, and streamline purchasing without ever exporting spreadsheets.
